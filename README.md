PredixAI - Ken Case Competition Submission

This repository contains the Round 2 deliverables for The Ken Case Competition, submitted by Anand [Your Last Name].

About PredixAI

PredixAI is a proof-of-concept Industrial IoT platform designed to disrupt the traditional equipment maintenance market, dominated by incumbents like L&T.

Our solution moves manufacturers from a costly, reactive "break-fix" model to a predictable, proactive "uptime-as-a-service" model. We use low-cost ESP32-based edge sensors and AI-driven anomaly detection to predict equipment failures (like bearing burnouts) weeks in advance, saving clients lakhs in unplanned downtime.

(This site was built as a single-page HTML application using Tailwind CSS, per the competition's technical guidelines.)

The second deliverable is the strategic document, which answers the three core questions from the brief.
